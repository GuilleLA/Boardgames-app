A quick invasion and regime change portended quiet reconstruction and good governance, but it was not to be so.

The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next. You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!",

To determine who shall rule the domain of man, the gods have devised a contest and lent their most powerful forces for the cause: pillage and raze three cities while trying to achieve feats set forth from the denizens of Olympus.

The game was nominated for the 2012 Golden Geek for best 2 Player game, and lauded by fans and reviewers for its simple and dynamic mechanics, myriad of combos, and gorgeous art. \r\n You could be the greatest warlord the isles have ever seen. Your thirst for power is matched only by your strategic wit and cunning. You know no rival, aside from your brother. \r\n As sons of Zeus, you stand poised to conquer all of Greece, but not without the blessing of the gods. To determine who shall rule the domain of man, the gods have devised a contest and lent their most powerful forces for the cause: pillage and raze three cities while trying to achieve feats set forth from the denizens of Olympus. When the carnage ends, only one brother will be victorious, while the other will fade into antiquity as just another half-god spawn of Zeus. \r\n To compete in this contest, players will take on the role of one of these two brothers with access to a powerful array of Units including Soldiers, Beasts, Oracles, Heroes, and Spirits; each with various uses. \r\n Each turn, the active player receives coins and/or draws cards.  They spend these coins to play Units to the 3 Cities to try to win wars to gain rewards, and to try to accomplish feats set forth by the gods of Olympus. \r\n ",

The year is 1979, players take the roles of Camp Counselors who are being stalked through a maze of cabins and camp trails by 'Otis', a homicidal killer with an unhealthy bear fetish. Working together, the Counselors explore the camp grounds while searching for a combination of objectives that can trigger one of four different game endings. Those who survive the finale win the game! It won't be easy. After every round of player turns, the NPC killer, Otis, stalks the closest targets around the board, attacking whenever he gets the chance. Unarmed players PANIC, are injured and forced to run away. Those lucky enough to have found protection are able to fight Otis with a dice roll. Better weapons mean higher value dice and a greater chance of success. Beat Otis and he disappears form the board until re-emerging from the woods on his next turn. Be warned, as the body count rises, Otis gains strength, moves faster and becomes more deadly. Just when you think you're safe, you may find him waiting right in front of you! If that's not bad enough, players must draw Cabin Cards which have a wide variety of game changing effects, both positive and negative. They contain Plot Twists, Cameos, weather changes, special Otis cards, clever Campers, helpful Weapons and Items, and fate tempting &quot;foolin' around&quot; cards. The Counselors won't give up so easily. In addition to their own inherent talents, Survival Cards grant the players unique abilities and tactics to help elude or confront the killer. Who, if anyone, will survive?",

It is - perhaps - one of the most cruel and ruthless of all our games. Money can be a dangerous weapon. During the game players open new branches and outlets, hire new workers and try to gain new capabilities. New Design Agencies, Brand stores or Preparation rooms are opened, Accountants, Models and Designers are hired, lucrative contracts are sign to allow for short-term profits and expand company's competencies. Every single month player's company gains new capabilities. Each quarter held fashion shows - each player has to prepare a collection of clothing and has to show it on the show. The public, media, experts estimate collections in four categories and award prizes and diplomas. The more awards (represented by 'stars' in the game) will be collected at the show, the more money the players earn for selling their collection. Will you get award for best Trends? Will you manage to be best in Public Relations and get the Media award? Will you earn more 'stars' than your opponent? If you win 'stars', your opponents don't. If you win 'stars', you earn more money. Your opponents don't. If you win 'stars', you earn money, you hire new stuff, you get better. Your opponents don't. That is why during show you will kill for every single 'star'. Welcome to the hell. Pret-a-Porter is a game for 2-4 players with a unique mix of deep economy strategy and direct interaction. Low luck element, many important decisions to be made and many strategies that can be used to acclaim victory. With a wide range of different employees, different buildings and contracts you can create your unique company every single time. Pret-a-Porter it's about counting money and it's about a dirty fight.

        "description": "<br />\r\n<b>Third Printing</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst published by GMT in 2003, A World at War is a grand strategy game based on the award-winning Advanced Third Reich/Empire of the Rising Sun gaming system. A World at War simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production aspects of the Second World War.

        "description": "The lineage of Here I Stand includes descent from both SPI's A Mighty Fortress (published in 1977) and GMT's The Napoleonic Wars (2002). Reusing the theme of A Mighty Fortress, the game improves on its predecessor with a much deeper system to handle religious conversions, the additions of New World exploration and Mediterranean piracy, and the explicit inclusion of minor powers that can be coerced into the conflict through card play. Borrowed from The Napoleonic Wars is the use of important cities to determine economic strength and elements of the land combat, avoid battle, and interception systems. Many game mechanics borrowed from The Napoleonic Wars were simplified to ensure a fast-paced game despite the wide range of factor considered by this design. From this base, the game adds mechanics unique to the 16th Century, including heavy use of short-term (and unreliable!) mercenaries, explicit wintering of armies, and the mercurial nature of siege operations, especially against targets that can be resupplied by sea. Here I Stand is an innovative game system, being the first to integrate religion, politics, economics and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3-4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 2, 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.",

Players divide into two teams and take on the role of pilots trying to shoot down the greatest number of enemy planes. In the midst of a tragic war, WWI fighter pilots fought bravely in a modern version of the medieval joust, much like the gallant knights that preceded them. Their survival depended greatly upon not only their skills, but also the quality of their aircraft. Blue Max, the famous game of World War I aerial combat, is back with new graphics and updated rules! In Blue Max, two to six players take the roles of pilots belonging to one of two teams, either the Allies or the Central Powers and aim to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible. With rules that account for altitude, fuel reserves and the maneuverability of your plane, Blue Max places you squarely in the cockpit and you'll need to both master your machine and outwit your foes in order to win.",

The region is also rich in salt ponds, and the salt in this period is worth more than gold. There doesn't exist a better place for a new city! The two grandsons of the King of Albalonga – the twins Romolo and Remo, descendants of Enea of Troy – don't want to miss an opportunity to dominate the region and, acting against each other, try to establish two cities close to the Tiber river. Their enterprise is not easy as the King of Antemnae and the King of Crustumerium will also fight to dominate this area! Who will prevail? In Romolo o Remo?, players act as Kings of the new cities in the Latium and have to compete with each other in order to gain control of the whole Region. Players must manage their kingdom and their growing settlement. Two aspects are crucial: the citizens, as players act with citizens to take many different actions, and the territory, as players can act only in the territories they are able to control – excluding when they go to war, of course! If the population grows, they can take more actions, but they must feed all of them as well. Money, resources, trades, city buildings, and specialized characters increase a player's possibilities, and soldiers, mercenaries, and war declarations can change the game's storyline at any moment.
